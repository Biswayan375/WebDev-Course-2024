			In <b><u>March <sup>19<sub>44</sub></sup></u></b>, military units were placed on alert in <em>Western Australia</em> after Allied forces detected the movement of a powerful group of <u><b>Japanese warships</b></u> in the Netherlands East Indies. The main Japanese fleet had been redeployed to Singapore the previous month, and it was feared that this force could attack Western Australia. <del>Reinforcements</del>, <ins>including</ins> six Royal Australian Air Force flying squadrons, were dispatched to safeguard Fremantle, Perth, and other cities. Other Allied air units were held at Darwin in the Northern Territory. An air raid warning was sounded in Fremantle and Perth on 10 March, but was a false alarm. Intensive patrols by the Allied militaries did not detect any Japanese warships off Western Australia, and most units stood down on 12 March. The deployment ended on 20 March after it was concluded that an attack was unlikely. The Japanese did not attempt an attack on Western Australia, and the ships that the Allies detected were escorts for a small raiding force.
